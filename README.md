[Project_1_Network_Diagram](https://github.com/TareqHasan18/CyberSecurity_BootCamp_Project_1/blob/main/Diagram/Network%20Diagramm.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Project 1 Red Team Network Diagram file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.
